Games

|Game Name|Wrapper Version|Working?|Notes [e.g. any bugs, is it perfect etc.]|
|:-------:|:---------:|:------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|Skyfall|Wrapper v1.1|5|Game runs at full speed with no critical issues. Minor graphical glitch with the Nitrosoft Title display|
|Redirection|Wrapper v1.1|2|Game boots fine once click is changed to enter, but you can't proceed due to lack of mouse_drag and graphical glitches|
|Game of Life|Wrapper v1.1|2|[Lewisk3's Game of Life] Boots with no issues, gets in-game, however you can't proceed due to no mouse click|
|Battle|Wrapper v1.1|2|Boots perfectly, however proceeding is impossible without clicking|
|Helios|Wrapper v1.1|2|Game loads, but a severe graphical glitch means you can't see anything|
|Breakout|Wrapper v1.1|4|Severe graphical issues, however controls are perfect and gameplay isn't critically affected|
|Building Game|Wrapper v1.1|3|Runs perfectly with minor graphical issues, proceeding past the title screen is impossible due to a lack of mouse click events|
|CCSand|Wrapper v1.1|1|Game fails to boot; game requires an advanced computer|
|CCSand (with patch)|Wrapper v1.1|2|Seems to work fine once booted, apart from the fact you can't do anything|
|CCSand|Wrapper v1.3|2|You can get in-game, however strange graphics and no mouse makes it unplayable|
|Fish Simulator|Wrapper v1.1|3|Graphical glitches include no scenery and no ground [and some odd contrast between the black background and fish], but otherwise perfect|
|TRON|Wrapper v1.1|5|Works without flaws, absolutely perfect! The "Red"/"Blue" in the top corner during gameplay should be removed in a patch (optionally, not game breaking) as it looks wrong|
|Whosit!|Wrapper v1.1|5|No issues apart from paint image not displaying, game itself is awful though, no gameplay|
|Bomb|Wrapper v1.1|2|Game boots, but you can't proceed past the loading screen due to no mouse controls|
