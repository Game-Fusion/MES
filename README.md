# MES

Mono[chrome] Entertainment System, or MES - the only monochrome based console.

The Mono Entertainment System, or MES, is the first console targeted at Monochrome users.

This is for you if:

* You like monochrome's simplistic style

* You're in survival and can't afford a resource-expensive advanced PC

* You're a collector

* You're a developer and would like to try something new

* You're not good with colour and would prefer to work with a simple black/white interface (colour blindness? just not good with colour?)

So let's say you didn't want one for these reasons. Why get a MES?

* Games are available to this day!

* Colour games can be played thanks to Gonow32's fantastic Colour-to-Mono wrapper

* It is a very unique and special system in its own right for doing what it shouldn't - by running colour games

Wait, hang on. Colour games?! I thought this was a monochrome console!

You're right. It is. But we're doing something no monochrome console has ever done before. The MES will trick the game by spoofing an advanced computer, and will convert all the colours on the fly to black/white. All of this is possible through Gonow32's superb wrapper.

Ever wanted Skyfall on a standard PC? Have a look at it on your MES - there were no major issues out of the box with the first revision of the wrapper. On top of this, the wrapper has received numerous updates and improvements to improve compatibility.

Anybody who is interested in the project, contact Mr_Iron2. If you would like to contact via Discord, contact TheMrIron2#9747.

### UPDATE 18/9/2017: MES is now an OPEN PLATFORM!

Yes, that's right! Now anybody and everybody can develop and release games independently for MES! MES is the first games system in ComputerCraft to become an officially open platform - and not only that, but now a barebones SDK is included *in every MES*!
