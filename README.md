# MES
Mono[chrome] Entertainment System, or MES - the only monochrome based console.

The Mono Entertainment System, or MES, is the first console targeted at Monochrome users.

This is for you if:

* You like monochrome's simple black/white style

* You're in survival and can't afford an expensive advanced PC

* You're a collector

* You're not good with colour and would prefer to work with a simple black/white interface (colour blindness? just not good with colour?)

So let's say you didn't want one for these reasons. Why get a MES?

* Games are available - and being reprinted in 2017!

* Colour games can be played thanks to Gonow32's fantastic Colour-to-Mono wrapper

* It is a very unique and special system in its own right for punching above its weight (by running colour games)

Wait, hang on. Colour games?! I thought this was a monochrome console!

You're right. It is. But we're doing something no monochrome console has ever done before. The MES will trick the game into thinking this is an advanced computer, and will convert all the colours automatically to black/white. All of this is possible through Gonow32's superb wrapper.

Ever wanted Skyfall on a standard PC? Have a look at it on your MES - there were absolutely no critical issues, and there was just one graphical glitch with the title screen only displaying the word "games" and not the full "nitrosoft games", and this was easily fixed.

Anybody who is interested in the project, contact Mr_Iron2.

### UPDATE: MES is now an OPEN PLATFORM!

Yes, that's right! Now anybody and everybody can develop and release games independently for MES! MES is the first games system in ComputerCraft to ever offer this - an official development disk is offered to anyone who asks for it, but not only that, but a basic SDK is included *in MES files* now!
