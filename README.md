# MES
Mono[chrome] Entertainment System, or MES - the only monochrome based console.

The Mono Entertainment System, or MES, is the first console targeted at Monochrome users.

This is for you if:

* You like monochrome's simple black/white style

* You're in survival and can't afford an expensive advanced PC

* You're a collector

* You're not good with colour and would prefer to work with a simple black/white interface (colour blindness? just not good with colour?)

So let's say you didn't want one for these reasons. Why get a MES?

* Games are available - and being reprinted in 2017!

* Colour games can be played thanks to Gonow32's fantastic Colour-to-Mono wrapper

* It is a very unique and special system in its own right for punching above its weight (by running colour games)

Wait, hang on. Colour games?! I thought this was a monochrome console!

You're right. It is. But we're doing something no monochrome console has ever done before. The MES will trick the game into thinking this is an advanced computer, and will convert all the colours automatically to black/white. All of this is possible through Gonow32's superb wrapper.

Ever wanted Skyfall on a standard PC? Have a look at it on your MES - there were absolutely no critical issues, and there was just one graphical glitch with the title screen only displaying the word "games" and not the full "nitrosoft games", and this was easily fixed.

Of course, not every game works perfectly. CCSand saw through our trick [fixed in Wrapper v1.3], and many games didn't work due to no mouse support. The wrapper is in early testing, and future plans would be to add an on-screen cursor to emulate a mouse click, controlled by WASD/arrow keys or similar controls.
