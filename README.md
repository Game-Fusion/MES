# MES
Mono[chrome] Entertainment System, or MES - the only monochrome based console.

The Mono Entertainment System, or MES, is going to be one of if not the only ever console targeted at Monochrome users.

This is for you if:

* You like monochrome's simple black/white style

* You're in survival and can't afford a resource-expensive advanced PC

* You're a collector

Seeing as this is kind of an oddity, it will be a collector's item too. Anybody who is interested in the project, contact Mr_Iron2.
