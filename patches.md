|Game Name|Notes|
|:-------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|Skyfall|Minor patch, simple graphical bug fixed, now has no issues|
|Redirection|Game boots fine as click is changed to enter, you can't proceed yet due to lack of mouse_drag and graphical glitches|

To be patched:

Helios

Battle

Redirection

Custom Breakout?

Building Game?

CCSand (would be important for compatibility purposes, however maybe we should wait for Super MES/SMES to implement these giant changes and just use MES to establish the wrapper works)

Fish Simulator (fixing graphical glitches)?

TRON (removing the red/blue indicator showing which colour you are in the top corner)
