To be patched:

|Game Name|Notes|
|:-------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|Battle|Minor patch required, mouse clicking is missing however you could change the buttons to keys without too much effort as this is a slow paced Pokemon-battle-esque game|
|Breakout|Semi-major patch required, some severe graphical glitches but game is otherwise playable|
|CCSand|This game is so problematic that the wrapper needed to be updated to boot this game - it still requires a patch for mouse support|
|Fish Simulator|Minor patch required, background is completely missing and the fish are hardly visible|
