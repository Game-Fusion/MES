To be patched:

|Game Name|Notes|
|:-------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|Helios|Major patch required, critical graphical glitch means the game boots however there is nothing on-screen|
|Redirection|Colossal amount of patching required, critical graphical glitches in levels and lack of mouse clicks and drags will make this extremely hard if not impossible|
|Battle|Minor patch required, mouse clicking is missing however you could change the buttons to keys without too much effort|
|Breakout|Semi-major patch required, some severe graphical glitches but game is otherwise playable|
|Building Game|Major patch required, game is heavily mouse reliant|
|CCSand|Really needs to be fixed, it is the only known game to see through the wrapper and recognise it as a monochrome PC - if the game were to boot, a major patch would be needed, as it is heavily reliant on the mouse - might want to wait until SMES to implement extreme changes like adding a mouse cursor and just use MES to confirm the wrapper works properly|
|Fish Simulator|Minor patch required, background is completely missing and the fish are hardly visible|
|TRON|Tiny patch required, simply remove the text in-game in the top corner indicating which "colour" you are|
